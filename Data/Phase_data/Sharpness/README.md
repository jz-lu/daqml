# DA vs Digital Learned PD sharpness comparisons

This directory contains the raw data files for the sharpness comparison plot presented in the paper, and Python code to calculate the sharpnesses and generate the plot.


#### Raw Data
<ul>
  <li>  <code> Testlosses_D </code>, <code> Testlosses_DA_Rbovera=0.98 </code>, and <code> Testlosses_DA_Rbovera=0.87 </code>  </li> are folders containing 1,300 final "test loss" arrays (i.e. Learned phase diagrams) for digital, DA with Rb/a = 0.98, and DA with Rb/a = 0.87 circuits respectively.  There are 100 arrays generated at each circuit depth (from 2 to 14), totalling in 1,300 per folder.
  
</ul>

#### Plotting code
  <ul>
    <li><code> learnedPD_plotting.py </code> generates the raw data above by averaging the results of 20 independent learning runs.  The results of these runs are specifically the test losses generated by running <code> cluster_pl.jl </code> (see PhaseLearning folder), which are named as follows: <code>Testlosses_d{d}_q{nq}_p{phase}_circ{circ}_its50_task{i+1}.npy </code>.<br />
After creating and saving these averaged data files, the code plots them as a 2x2 set of contour plots, with training point labeled.  This code will also overlay the contour lines defined for the XXZ order parameter plots (see XXZOrderParameterPlots folder).
