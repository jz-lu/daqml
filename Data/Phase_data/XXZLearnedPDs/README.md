# XXZ chain Learned Phase Diagram plotting

This directory contains the raw data files for the averaged learned phase diagrams presented in the paper, and Python code to generate the plots.


#### Raw Data
<ul>
  <li>  <code> vbs_8_averaged.npy </code>, <code> qzafm_8_averaged.npy </code>, <code> zafm_8_averaged.npy </code>, <code> xafm_8_averaged.npy </code>  </li> are 20x20 arrays of the final test loss for the DA circuit, trained in the 4 respective phase regions.  Each file is generated by averaging over 20 runs in the respective phase region (details of this averaging explained in next section).
  
</ul>

#### Plotting code
  <ul>
    <li><code> op_plotting.py </code> imports the raw data, defines the contour lines for each plot, and plots a 2x2 set of labeled contour plots.</li>
  </ul>
