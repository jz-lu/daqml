# XXZ chain Learned Phase Diagram plotting

This directory contains the raw data files for the averaged learned phase diagrams presented in the paper, and Python code to generate the plots.


#### Raw Data
<ul>
  <li>  <code> vbs_8_averaged.npy </code>, <code> qzafm_8_averaged.npy </code>, <code> zafm_8_averaged.npy </code>, <code> xafm_8_averaged.npy </code>  </li> are 20x20 arrays of the final test loss for the 8-qubit, depth 2 DA circuit, trained in the 4 respective phase regions.  Each file is generated by averaging over 20 runs in the respective phase region (details of this averaging explained in next section).
  
</ul>

#### Plotting code
  <ul>
    <li><code> learnedPD_plotting.py </code> generates the raw data above by averaging the results of 20 independent learning runs.  The results of the To do this, the code relies on the careful naming of the final test loss files , defines the contour lines for each plot, and plots a 2x2 set of labeled contour plots.</li>
  </ul>
