# XXZ chain Learned Phase Diagram plotting

This directory contains the raw data files for the averaged learned phase diagrams presented in the paper, and Python code to generate the plots.


#### Raw Data
<ul>
  <li>  <code> vbs_8_averaged.npy </code>, <code> qzafm_8_averaged.npy </code>, <code> zafm_8_averaged.npy </code>, <code> xafm_8_averaged.npy </code>  </li> are 20x20 arrays of the final test loss for the 8-qubit, depth 2 DA circuit, trained in the 4 respective phase regions.  Each file is generated by averaging over 20 runs in the respective phase region (details of this averaging explained in next section).
  
</ul>

#### Plotting code
  <ul>
    <li><code> learnedPD_plotting.py </code> generates the raw data above by averaging the results of 20 independent learning runs.  The results of these runs are specifically the test losses generated by running <code> cluster_pl.jl </code> (see PhaseLearning folder), which are named as follows: <code> Testlosses_d{d}_q{nq}_p{phase}_circ{circ}_its50_task{i+1}.npy </code>.  After creating and saving these averaged data files, the code plots them as a 2x2 set of contour plots, with training point labeled.  This code will also overlay the contour lines defined for the XXZ order parameter plots (see XXZOrderParameterPlots folder). </li>
  </ul>
