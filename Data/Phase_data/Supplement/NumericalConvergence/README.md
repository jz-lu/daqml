# Numerical Convergence

This directory contains the raw data files for the numerical convergence plots in the paper's supplement, and Python code to generate the plots.


#### Raw Data
<ul>
  <li>  <code> xy_8_DA_averaged.npy </code>  </li> is a 20x20 array of the final test loss for the 8-qubit, depth 0 (i.e. rotations only) circuits, trained in the XY-QLRO phase region.  This file is generated by averaging over 20 runs.  The 20 raw "test losses" files are provided in the <code>Depth0_Teslosses</code>.  These are sample output files achieved from running <code>pl_noisy_D.jl</code> and <code>pl_noisy_DA.jl</code> or <code>cluster_pl.jl</code>(see PhaseLearning folder).
  <li> For the raw data for the 3vs8 comparison conversion plot, see the <code>MNIST_data</code> folder.</li>
  
</ul>

#### Plotting code
  <ul>
    <li><code> convergence.py </code> generates the averaged plot mentioned above by averaging the results of 20 independent learning runs.  The results of these runs are specifically the test losses generated by running <code> cluster_pl.jl </code> (see PhaseLearning folder), which are named as follows: <code>Testlosses_d{d}_q{nq}_p{phase}_circ{circ}_its50_task{i+1}.npy </code>.<br />
After creating and saving this averaged data file, the code plots it as a contour plot, with training point labeled.
