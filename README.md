# daqml
This is `daqml`, a repository for performing variational quantum learning algorithms with Rydberg digital-analog quantum circuits. There are two folders: one for performing binary classification on the `MNIST` dataset and one for identifying boundaries of quantum phases.

See the `README.md` in each respective folder for details on executing the code.
